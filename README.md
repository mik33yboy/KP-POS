Coding Guidelines
Naming Conventions
Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., MyClass).
Use snake_case for variables and functions (e.g., my_variable, my_function()).
Indentation
Use consistent indentation, typically 4 spaces or a tab.
Ensure that the code is easy to read and follows a logical structure.
Comments
Include comments to explain complex logic, important decisions, or any code that might be unclear to others.
Keep comments up-to-date with the code changes.
Whitespace
Use whitespace to improve code readability.
Avoid excessive use of whitespace, especially trailing spaces.
Modularity
Encapsulate logical components into functions or methods for reusability.
Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - each function/method should have a single responsibility.
Error Handling
Implement proper error handling and logging where necessary.
Avoid using exceptions for flow control.
Consistency
Maintain consistency in coding style across the project.
Follow language-specific conventions and guidelines.
Version Control
Use version control systems (e.g., Git) and commit frequently with meaningful commit messages.
Avoid committing commented-out code or debugging statements.
Testing
Write unit tests for critical functionality.
Run tests before committing changes to ensure code stability.
Documentation
Provide clear and concise documentation for APIs, classes, and functions.
Include information on parameters, return values, and usage examples.
Security
Be mindful of security best practices, especially when dealing with user input.
Performance
Optimize code for performance only when necessary. Focus on readability first.
Profile code to identify bottlenecks before making optimizations.
